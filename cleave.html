        <p>Flag a corner on a tiny snowbird's wing,</p>
        <p>then notch two X's out a' sea—</p>

        <p>Bring a hill to fury on.</p>
        <p>Remake your glory day</p>
        <p>From our fantastic youth — a playful act —</p>
        <p>An ease I lend but ill not give away</p>

        <p>to hail my curl at its home</p>
